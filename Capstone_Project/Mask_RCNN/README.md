# Mask R-CNN for ONL Cell Detection

This is an implementation of Mask R-CNN model.

The repository includes:
* Main code for training and testing in Jupyter notebook (Main_Code.ipynb)
* Source code of Mask R-CNN (config.py, model.py, parallel_model.py, utils.py, visualize.py)
* Pre-trained weights for ImageNet (mask_RCNN.h5)
* The code for preparation the data (dataset_preparation.py)
* The paper which published in the Journal

In this code I used some reference codes:
* Mask R-CNN model: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
* COCO format: https://github.com/akTwelve/cocosynth

Also, I used the VIA 2.0.8 (VGG Image Annotator) software to annotate images, based on COCO standard format.
The data is not uploaded here as the size is large.
