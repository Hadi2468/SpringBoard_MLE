# Classification of MNIST_DIGITS data with a CNN model 

This is an implementation of CNN model.

The repository includes:
* Main code for training and testing in Jupyter notebook (Capstone_MNIST_DIGITS.ipynb)
* Pre-trained weights for ImageNet (cnn_mnist_digits_wt.h5)


In this code I used MNIST_DIGITS dataset. The data is not uploaded here as the size is large.
